# Memory Allocation Visualizer

## Overview
Memory Allocation Visualizer is an interactive educational tool designed to help students and developers understand memory allocation strategies, specifically paging and segmentation techniques. The application provides a visual representation of how memory is allocated and managed in computer systems.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for memory allocation simulation
- Two memory allocation methods:
  - Paging
  - Segmentation
- Real-time memory visualization
- Process management (add, remove, auto-generate)
- Detailed memory statistics
- Event logging
- Configurable memory and page sizes

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PravinChoduahry11/memory-allocation-Tracker.git
cd memory-allocation-Tracker
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Simulation Controls
- **Memory Size**: Total memory size in units
- **Page Size**: Size of each memory page
- **Allocation Method**: Choose between paging and segmentation
- **Simulation Speed**: Control the pace of process generation
- **Auto-generate Processes**: Automatically create random processes

### Process Management
- **Add Process**: Manually add a process with specified size and lifetime
- **Remove Process**: Remove a specific process by its ID
- **Add Random Process**: Generate a process with random size
